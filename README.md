# 65_Natyan

The 65_Natyan is a custom 65% mechanical keyboard. It has individually addressable SK6812 led under each key. It is hotswappable and support both Cherry MX and Kailh Choc switches.

# Work in progress

This project is currently being developed, thus it is not sure that all will work.

## PCB

The Kicad project is accessible in the folder "pcb_files". You can open it to export the GERBER files and then order the PCB.

## Firmware

The firmware is based on [qmk_firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware). To flash the firmware, just follow the instructions given on the QMK docs.

## 3dModels

You can find the 3d models of the case I designed for this keyboard. 
To get it, you need to 3d print them, and wherever there is a hole for a fastener, you need to install a heat-press insert.
